## Reflection

I learned how to create tables, insert data, and perform basic queries in SQL through this assignment. One challenge I faced was ensuring the data types were correctly matched with the columns when inserting data. Additionally, I had to pay close attention to detail when writing queries to avoid syntax errors. This hands-on practice helped solidify my understanding of SQL basics.
